Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.

Git switch and git checkout are both used to change branches, but they have some differences in syntax and behavior. Git switch is a newer command that is more focused on branches, while git checkout is an older command that can do other things besides switching branches.
At its core, Git rebase is a command that helps you restructure your commit history. Instead of merging changes as they are, Git rebase integrates the commits from one branch onto another. This results in a cleaner, more linear commit history, making your project's history easier to understand and manage.
